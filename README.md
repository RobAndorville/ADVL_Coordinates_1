25th July 2016 : I'm still working out how to use GitHub and organise the software projects.

ADVL_Coordinates is a coordinate conversion program that uses the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset.
This data can be found at http://www.epsg.org/EPSGhome.aspx

ADVL_Coordinates_1 is written in Visual Basic 2015.
Only the UTM projection has been implemented but the parameters for all coordinate systems imported from the EPSG Dataset can be viewed.
The program uses two library projects ADVL_Coordinates_Library_1 and ADVL_Utilities_Library_1.
These additional projects will be added to GitHub soon.

The Software was written to demonstrate the ADVL_Application_Network_1 software.  
This is a system for connecting a number of Andorville (TM) Applications.
This collection of simple, single purpose applications interact to perform higher level functions.

Another project, ADVL_Coordinates_Client_1, shows how the applications communicate across the network.
